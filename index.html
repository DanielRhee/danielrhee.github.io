<h1>Hi, I'm Daniel Rhee</h1>
        <p> I am a Computer Science undergraduate student at the
<a href="https://www.ucsc.edu" target = "_blank">UC Santa Cruz</a> (2024 - 2027). <a
href="coursework.html">Relevant Formal Academics</a></p>
<p>I am actively seeking opportunities in research, grad school,
and internships.</p>
        <p> My primary interests are in Computer Vision and
Computational Physics and Computational Biology. </p>
<p> You may view my <a href="resume.pdf">full resume here</a>, however
a more comprehensive and technical description of my work is on this
website (especially in the 'Read More here' portions) </p>
        <h2> Things I work on </h2>
        <p><a href="https://formulaslug.com/" target="_blank"> Formula
SAE</a> where I am the driverless racing lead, primarily working with
perception, mapping, and control theory but I also work vehicle
dynamics simulations. <a href="FormulaSlug.html">Read
more here </a></p>
        <p><a href="https://aiea-lab.github.io/" target="_blank"> AIEA
Lab</a> where I work on robustifying autonomous vehicles and
specifically work on the
Waymo open dataset challenge. <a href="AIEA.html">Read more here </a></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/DanielRhee/SkyPi">SkyPi</a> where I work on an astrophotography focused raw image
capturing system for the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera as well as astrophotography image stacking and
processing from the FITS format</p>
<p>Radio Telescope where I use an RTL SDR to attempt and track satellites</p>
<h2> Some things I did </h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Linux foundation - FOCUS Project</a> where I was an SWE intern working on validating conformance of FOCUS FinOps data outputted by all major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc) </p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/DanielRhee/BreastCancerTumorSegmentation" target="_blank"> Breast Cancer Tumor Segmentation and Classification</a> winning best AI/ML award for the BioHacks 2025 hackathon and utilized a UNET for segmentation and a CNN to classify risk </p>
        <p><a href="https://emitlab.ece.uw.edu/" target=_blank"> EMiT Lab<a> where I worked on automated analogue circuit design </p>
        <p><a
href="https://github.com/DanielRhee/Yellowstone-Geyser-Prediction"
target=_blank"> Yellowstone Geyser Prediction </a> where I predicted
geyser eruption times using regression techniques </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DanielRhee/coderunner">Code runner</a>
a web based application using a Flask backend to run code (Python,
C++, Java, C) on an external server and return the output to your
browser. </p>
<h2> Fun things </h2>
<p> I am a licensed ham radio operator and sometimes do things like POTA</p>
<p> I participated in the 2025 Putnam exam </p>
<p> I like speedcubing! I use ZZ (CPLS) and average ~12 seconds. I
also do 2x2 and average mid/high 3s and 4x4 mid 50s. </p>
<p> I sometimes speed jigsaw puzzle too, and compete (but do quite
poorly) </p>
<p> I also dance in my free time, I am the cohead of JK Family Kazoku Kajok at UCSC
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JKFamily-f1n">choreograph and
teach semi regularly</a> </p>
<p> I also beekeep sometimes.</p>
